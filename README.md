# BasicWebPage
 <pre>
   A basic web page application I created to familiarize myself further with concepts such
       - HTML
       - CSS
       - JavaScript
       - React

   I wished to learn these concepts as I want to pursue creating new web applications and wanted to incorporate React.
   Utilizing React will allow me to create highly dynamic webpages, and the ability to have reusable components streamlines
   a lot of the coding process.

   This webpage in particular is an overall very basic version of a React page. It had 3 main boxes one for linkes, another as a main landing
   and small piece on my coding experience, and finally a ToDo List. The ToDo list is the piece that makes the most use of the React components
   and its overall utilities.
